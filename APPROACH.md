# Approach log

Written *before* coding each task, in my own words. Wrong is fine — this is the reasoning
record the program grades. Updated after, with what actually happened.

Template for each task:

```
## Task N — <name>

### Before
- Accounts involved (which exist already, which get created, who owns each):
- Who signs, and why each signature is needed:
- Who pays, for what:
- Instructions, in order, and which program each goes to:
- What I'm unsure about:

### After
- What was wrong in my plan:
- Errors I hit, my hypothesis for each, and what the real cause was:
- What I'd explain differently now:

## Task 1 — Mint and transfer an SPL token

### Before
- spl_init creates an SPL token mint. THe signature authorizes the creation of a keypair that can be used to create a mint account.
- The mint account needs to know the size determind by the token program.
- the person establishing the account pays the rent, and it is received by the account owner. 
- Where will the 100 tokens live? - they will live in the token account, which is associated with the mint account, and the owner of the wallet that holds the balance in the account
- The ATA is a specific PDA whose seeds are fixed by the associated Token Program: [ owner, tokenProgram, mint]. They are fixed so any wallet, explorer, or exchange can compute your "USDC account" (for example) from just your address, with no lookup. I Believe getCreateAssociatedTokenIdempotentInstructionAsync creates it. Idempotent variant succeeds silently if the account exists, and creates it if not. 
- InitializeMint stored your address as the authority. MintTo has to prove the caller is that authority, the proof on Solana is a signature. So the slot needs a signer object, not the address.
- It should be 100,000,000 base units if we are using 100 with 6 decimals, or 100n * 10n ** 6n
- Not clear on the instructions, may need to review this piece


### After
Successfully created both instructions for the creating the account and getting the instruction: 6gxbB27RCNTZpS1RHvL8FgwgwAt5bkgWgryih82NrB5s
